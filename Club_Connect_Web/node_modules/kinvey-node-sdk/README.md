# Kinvey NodeJS SDK [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Kinvey/kinvey-nodejs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Kinvey/kinvey-nodejs) [![Code Climate](https://codeclimate.com/github/Kinvey/kinvey-nodejs/badges/gpa.svg)](https://codeclimate.com/github/Kinvey/kinvey-nodejs) [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/Kinvey/kinvey-nodejs/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/Kinvey/kinvey-nodejs)

[Kinvey](http://www.kinvey.com) (pronounced Kin-vey, like convey) makes it ridiculously easy for developers to setup, use and operate a cloud backend for their mobile apps. They don't have to worry about connecting to various cloud services, setting up servers for their backend, or maintaining and scaling them.

This node module makes it very easy to connect your NodeJS app with Kinvey.

## How to use

#### 1. Sign up for Kinvey
To use the SDK, sign up for Kinvey if you have not already done so. Go to the [sign up](https://console.kinvey.com/#signup) page, and follow the steps provided.

#### 2. Install the SDK
You can install the module using npm:

```bash
npm install kinvey-node-sdk --save
```

#### 3. Configure the SDK
Import the library in your code using `require`.

```javascript
var Kinvey = require('kinvey-node-sdk');
```

Next, use `Kinvey.init` to configure your app. Replace `<appKey>` and `<appSecret>` with your apps app key and secret. You can find these for your app using the [Kinvey Console App](https://console.kinvey.com).

```javascript
Kinvey.init({
    appKey: '<appKey>',
    appSecret: '<appSecret>'
});
```

#### 4. Verify Set Up
You can use the following snippet to verify the app credentials were entered correctly. This function will contact the backend and verify that the SDK can communicate with your app.

```javascript
Kinvey.ping().then(function(response) {
  console.log('Kinvey Ping Success. Kinvey Service is alive, version: ' + response.version + ', response: ' + response.kinvey);
}).catch(function(error) {
  console.log('Kinvey Ping Failed. Response: ' + error.message);
});
```
